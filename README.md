## Development

### Day 1

I spent most of the day creating my wirframes for my front-end and writing out the routes for my back-end.

### Day 2 - 3
    Over the weekend I created my data on postman for all my routes and then after creating my JXS componenets I made sure my data flowed from my back-end routes.

## Future Implementations
    Over the break instead of linking to the amazon website, I'am going to try to implement the actual amazon Api .
